## 🌟 Overview

A comprehensive Xiangqi platform featuring AI gameplay, board recognition, and extensive puzzle libraries. Built with modern web technologies and fully functional offline.

**Key Highlights:**
- 🤖 Local AI engine powered by Pikafish
- 📸 Open-source board recognition system (physical boards + screenshots)
- 📚 7,300+ puzzles covering openings, endgames, and classical positions
- 📱 Complete offline support via PWA
- ⚖️ Intelligent rule enforcement (checkmate, stalemate, perpetual check/chase detection)

---

## Features

### Game Modes
- ♟️ **Two-Player Mode** - Local or online play
- 🤖 **AI Opponent** - Multiple difficulty levels (PC & Android)
- ⏱️ **Chess Clock** - Tournament-style time controls

### Learning Tools
- 🧠 **Game Review** - Deep AI analysis of completed games (PC only)
- 📊 **Position Analysis** - Real-time move suggestions (PC & Android)
- 📚 **Puzzle Library** - 7,300+ curated positions:
  - Opening patterns (~200 puzzles)
  - Classical endgames (366 puzzles)
  - Complex tactical positions (183 puzzles)
  - Fundamental checkmate patterns
  - Historical game studies

### Board Recognition System

**Industry-first open-source implementation** for Xiangqi board recognition.

#### Two Recognition Modes

**1. Physical Board Recognition**
- Supports wooden, paper, and various physical boards
- Automatic perspective correction (handles camera angles)
- Intelligent coordinate mapping
- Best results with light-colored pieces

**2. Digital Screenshot Recognition**
- Optimized for digital board interfaces
- Dual-model architecture: Detection + Classification
- Automatic side (red/black) identification
- No perspective correction needed

#### Model Files

| Model | Purpose | File |
|-------|---------|------|
| Online Detection | Locate piece positions | `online_xiangqi_piece_detector.onnx` |
| Online Classification | Identify piece types | `online_xiangqi_classifier.onnx` |
| Physical Board | Unified physical board recognition | `Entity_chess_recognition_model.onnx` |

#### Usage Example

```javascript
// Example: Integrate recognition (pseudocode)
const recognizer = new ChessRecognizer();

// Upload image
recognizer.uploadImage(imageFile);

// Mark four corners and center pawn (for calibration)
recognizer.markCorners([topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft]);
recognizer.markCenterPawn(centerPosition);

// Execute recognition
const fenCode = await recognizer.recognize();
console.log(fenCode); // Outputs FEN notation
```

> 💡 See source code for detailed API documentation

### Intelligent Rule System

Automatic detection of:
- ✅ Checkmate and stalemate
- ✅ Draw by insufficient material
- ✅ Draw by repetition
- ✅ Perpetual check/chase detection
- 📜 Based on ROC Xiangqi Rules (2024 revision)

Most positions are correctly adjudicated automatically. In edge cases, players should apply official rules manually.

### Utilities
- 🔄 **Undo Move** - Take back moves
- 💾 **Save/Load Positions** - Store and retrieve games
- ⚙️ **Position Editor** - Create custom legal positions
- 🎨 **Customization** - 5 board themes + 5 piece styles

## Project Motivation

> Hi, I'm a high school sophomore who developed Xiangqi Arena initially as a school project, but mainly driven by my passion for Chinese Chess.
> 
> Existing Xiangqi software often suffers from either overly complex interfaces or lack of modern features. I combined my programming skills to create a platform that's both professional and accessible.
> 
> The core mission is **improving players' skills** through AI analysis, game review, and diverse practice modes. I hope to nurture talented Xiangqi players and bring honor to Taiwan's Xiangqi community!
